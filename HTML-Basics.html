        <h1>HTML BoilerPlate</h1>

        <p>VSCode HTML Boilerplate shortcut can also be used by typing '!' and choosing the first option</p>

        <h1>Basic HTML Elements</h1>
            <h2>Working with Text</h2>
                <p>For paragraphs, the <strong><em>p</em></strong> element is used. To make a character or text bold or italicized, the <strong><em>strong</em></strong> or <strong><em>em</em></strong> elements are used, respectively.</p>
            <h2>Links and Images</h2>
                <p>Links use the anchor element <strong><em>a</em></strong> and attribute <strong><em>href</em></strong>; can either use <strong>absolute</strong> or <strong>relative</strong> links. <strong>Aboslute</strong> links are links to pages on other websites, while <strong>Relative</strong> links are links to other pages within our own website. The latter does not include a domain name, as it assumes the domain name to be the same as the page the link was created on. For example, href="pages/about.html" is a relative link and assumes that the domain is index.html where the link is created</p>
                
                <p>Images use element <strong><em>img</em></strong> and attributes <strong><em>src</em></strong> to provide image source, either locally or through a url, and <strong><em>alt</em></strong> which provides a short description of the image in case it doesn't load in properly</p>

            <h2>Lists</h2>    
                <p>Lists use either <strong><em>ul</em></strong> or <strong><em>ol</em></strong> for either unordered or ordered lists. List elements are then indented under <strong><em>ul</em></strong> or <strong><em>ol</em></strong> with the <strong><em>li</em></strong> element.</p>
